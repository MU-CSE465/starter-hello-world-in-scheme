# Hello World in Scheme

Use the scheme programming language do some basic operations.  
You can use `mit-scheme` to test this on `ceclnx0.csi.miamioh.edu` by connecting with your favorite SSH client. 
You can also test it using the excellent https://racket-lang.org/  
However, **be aware, using non-standard features of mit or drscheme are not allowed**. 
In particular, you should not use unapproved API functions or language features not covered in the book or class. 

#  Tasks
1.  Modify the file `hello-world.scm`  to display the _exact_ text below:
    ```
    Hello, world!
    ```
    Please note, there is NO leading or trailing whitespace.   There is exactly one space after the comma. 
      
    In general, I will not remind you of that every time since you can select the text to see the whitespace, or copy it into an editor. 

# Grading
This assigmenet will be _automatically_ graded by running test cases and static code analysis. 
If you are not used to this process, it means that your program must _exactly_ match expected results, including __spelling__, the amount of __white space__ and also __case__ of  your output. You may commit your code as much as you like before the deadline without penalty in order to check your work.  Beware of copy/paste from websites because, not only is it ethically wrong and against the code of conduct, websites often use Unicdoe characters that look identical to the expected output but, in fact, are different. 

There is no partial credit for each test -- to receive credit for a particular test you may resubmit until you get it correct. You will instead lose points for late submissions if you are unable to complete it on time.
